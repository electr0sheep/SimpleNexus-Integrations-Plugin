    <p>Please understand that this is not a loan approval. This is not a commitment to lend, nor does it guarantee a specific rate. The interest rate and type of mortgage used to pre-qualify you for this loan amount is subject to change.</p>
    <p>Once you complete a loan application with us we can submit to underwriting for a conditional loan approval, subject to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Verification of information provided on the loan application</li>
      <li>Underwriter review and acceptance of required documentation including credit, income and assets</li>
      <li>Acceptable appraisal and title commitment</li>
      <li>Satisfaction of all approval conditions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This pre-qualification is valid for 60 calendar days from the date of this letter and is subject to change as updated information is received.</p>
    <p>Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>
